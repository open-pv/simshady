# How does this work
To model the yield of PV systems, simshady takes two major factors into account: weather or climate and local objects that cause shading. 
## A scene of 3D geometries
The yield of PV systems placed on a building depends on the shading effects of the building itself, neighboring buildings, vegetation, and nearby mountains. Hence, in simshady, a [`ShadingScene`](/docs/classes/index.ShadingScene.html) is created and populated by adding `three.js` geometries. A main geometry is added using the `addMainGeometry()`. This is the geometry that will be simulated, i.e. the geometry of PV panels or of the building of interest. With `addShadingGeometry()`, geometries are added that are responsible for shading, i.e. buildings or trees from the neighbourhood.



## Weather, Climate, and Skydomes
From [NREL](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) we receive time series of measured and modeled GHI and DNI for every location in Germany. In these measured values, the direction of irradiance is not provided, hence we need to model it. We use the [HEALPix](https://doi.org/10.1086/427976) to divide the upper hemisphere into 96 pixels of equal size.

For every time step of the provided series, we do the following:
    - We add the Direct Normal Irradiance (short: DNI) to the sky segment where the sun is at the given point in time
    - We add the difference of Global Horizontal Irradiance (short: GHI) and DNI equally to all sky segments, so that the sum of each of these diffuse contributions multiplied with the sinus of the altitude angle is equal to the diffuse contribution to the GHI.
As a result, a flat surface receives a total irradiance of 
```DNI x sin(altitude) + SUM(Diffuse_from_each_segment x sin(altitude))```

## Performant Simulation on the GPU
The calculations for each triangle of the simulated building are independant of each other, hence the whole simulation can be parallelized. To simulate shading, the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm is used, which walks along the line of sight between simulated triangle and the sun and checks if it intersects with other geometries. 
We implemented this algorithm in WebGL, so that it can run on the GPU.
